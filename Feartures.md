# Introduction #

Enhanced version of [light-manager-c](https://code.google.com/p/light-manager-c/), a small linux program which allows you to control your [jbmedia Light Manager](http://cms.jbmedia.de) connected via USB.


# Details #

The program uses LibUSB 1.0, the source given here was compiled and testet on the ARM GNU/Linux box [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

It can be used either
  * as a server program listening
    * either on a TCP port
    * or as a http server
  * as a standalone program executing commands from the command line

The program supports the following features:
  * FS20 commands
  * Uniroll commands
  * InterTechno commands
  * Trigger scenes
  * Reading temperature sensor
  * Reading device clock
  * Set device clock
  * multi TCP client connections
  * Run as a real daemon
  * Optional logging to syslog
  * http get requests


## Compiling ##

  * **Option 1**: Use make with the given Makefile
  * **Option 2**: gcc lightmanager.c -lusb-1.0 -olightmanager

## Usage ##

Start the program using

> `sudo ./lightmanager -?`

to get the full help page:
```
Usage: lightmanager [OPTION]

Options are:
    -c cmd        Execute command <cmd> and exit (separate several commands by ';' or ',')
    -d            Start as daemon (default no)
    -g            Debug mode (default no)
    -h housecode  Use <housecode> for sending FS20 data (default 1111)
    -p port       Listen on TCP <port> for command client (default 3456)
    -s            Redirect output to syslog instead of stdout (default)
    -?            Prints this help and exit
    -v            Prints version and exit
```

When using lightmanager with -c the following cmd are available:
```

## Examples ##

### Use it as a server ###

1. First start the server on a given machine where the [jbmedia Light Manager](http://cms.jbmedia.de) is connected to via USB.
Here we want to use housecode 11223344 for FS20 commands and having the server listen on TCP port 55000:
```
sudo ./lightmanager -d -s -h 11223344 -p 55000
```

2. Now you can use
  * a telnet session to communicate with the Light Manager connected on the server (assuming the server can be connected using the name `usb-machine`):
```
telnet usb-machine 55000
Trying 192.168.1.1...
Connected to usb-machine.
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome to Linux Lightmanager v2.0 (build 0015)
>fs20 1133 on
OK
>fs20 1133 off
OK
>get clock
Thu Aug 16 14:59:24 2012
>get temp
25.5 degree Celsius
>fs20 1133 20%
OK
>quit
bye
Connection closed by foreign host.
```


  * a browser to connect to the Lightmanager http server which then communicates with the Light Manager device connected to the server, for example the url <pre>  http://192.168.1.1:55000/cmd=get temp</pre> returns <pre>  23.5 Â°C</pre> the url <pre>  http://192.168.1.1:55000/cmd=get time</pre> returns <pre>  Sat Jan 12 15:14:13 2013</pre>Multiple commands can be delimited by a '&' character, example <pre>http://192.168.1.1:55000/cmd=get time&get temp</pre>

### Use it with command line commands ###

#### Set the clock to machine time ####
```
sudo ./lightmanager -c "set clock"
```

#### Read clock and temperature ####
```
sudo ./lightmanager -c "get clock; get temp"
```

#### Dim FS20 dimmer with the address 1133 starting with 25%, ending on 100%, then switch off after 10 seconds ####
```
sudo ./lightmanager -h 11223344 -c "fs20 1133 25%; wait 1000; fs20 1133 50%; wait 1000; fs20 1133 100%; wait 10000; fs20 1133 off"
```
